My name is Olivia Halliday Hoyt. I'm a Physician Assistant student in my final year at Wake Forest University.
This year I will finish my last rotations in pediatrics, emergency, surgery, and palliative care.
I have completed rotations in internal medicine, women's health, rheumatology, behavioral health, gastroenterology, and family medicine.
I am highly interested in preventive medicine and increasing access to primary care.
