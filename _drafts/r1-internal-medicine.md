My first rotation in clinical year of PA school was in Internal Medicine, with the Hospital Medicine team at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital.

I was pretty nervous for my first rotation, especially as Internal Medicine has one of the largest topic lists for the end of rotation exam. 
I had never worked in an in-patient setting before, so I was also very confused about what Internal Medicine was, how it was different from Hospital Medicine, and how it related to ICU care, the step-down unit, and the floor. 
Turns out, Internal Medicine is the specialty focused on preventing, diagnosing, and treating diseases in adults in an out-patient setting, while Hospital Medicine is the coordination of primary care and specialist care for hospitalized patients that are not in the ICU.
Patients in the step-down or Intermediate Care Unit no longer need the ICU but are not ready to go to the regular floor, where patients with fewer risks for decompensation are.
