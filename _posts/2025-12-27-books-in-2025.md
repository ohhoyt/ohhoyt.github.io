PA school is extremely rewarding, but can also be very draining. 
It is very important to continue to enjoy your hobbies and remember that life outside of school exists. 
As a lifelong reader, it had been a while since I had the time and energy to enjoy reading, so one of my New Year's Resolutions was to read 12 books this year. 
I exceeded my own expectations!

These are the books I read in 2025:
1. Wind and Truth (Stormlight Archives #5) by Brandon Sanderson
1. Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman
1. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
1. Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut
