I have always been interested in science. In high school the classes 
I enjoyed most were chemistry and biology, so when it came time to apply 
for colleges, I was looking at biochemistry programs. I have learned since 
then that biochemistry isn’t really just a mix of biology and chemistry, 
but I’ve come to love it all the same. I ended up at Northeastern University 
in Boston, where I’ve been exposed to many different research projects through 
various talks. During my first semester I took a Biological Inquiries class 
focused on Genetics and Genomics with Phyllis Strauss that opened my eyes to 
how scientific research was a complex web that was never truly finished.

In the spring of 2019, I started my first co-op experience (i.e., full-time,
6 month internship between semesters) at the Merck Exploratory Science Center 
in Cambridge, MA. There I worked on early research for a possible treatment of
Inflammatory Bowel Disease, research that I was very interested in due to family 
history. My role was to explore the functional role of non-coding RNAs in 
regulating epithelial barrier function and to uncover the underlying molecular
mechanism using chemical biology tools. As my first true research experience, I 
gained a wide perspective on innovative scientific collaboration and the pharmaceutical 
research pipeline.

In the spring of 2020, I began my second co-op at Indigo Agriculture as a plant
microbiologist. I wanted to try a different field in industry, and Indigo’s mission 
and research opportunities fascinated me. I was originally responsible for creating 
axenic cultures of mycorrhizal fungi in order to test the effects of mycorrhiza on plant 
growth, however the coronavirus cut that work short before I could finish. While working 
from home I instead contributed to a compound identification database for the nomination 
of microbes into our pipeline and to a citation database for genes already used in our 
nomination process. While I greatly enjoyed working with my colleagues, I decided that 
plant microbiology wasn’t for me. 

I’ll be finishing my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry in May 2021.
